A dark color theme I have developed over the years for Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It gets its name from the emphasis on dark background colors and warm accent colors. The most supported language is Python, which has been tinkered with extensively to produce meaningful syntax highlighting.

Official Language Support:

* Python
* Java
* ini
